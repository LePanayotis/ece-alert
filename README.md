# ECE NTUA FACULTY ANNOUNCEMENT EMAIL ALERTS

Due to some upcoming reforms in the tertiary education in Greece,
the secretary of the Electrical & Computer Engineering Faculty of the NTUA
has been uploading a series of announcements on the faculty's website. However,
this does not include any notifications via any channels. That's why in one night I
decided to make a simple and **not elegant** solution that polls for new announcements and
notifies me in my email address, so that I don't have to manually check the website regularly.

I hope others can benefit from this :)
